// Approach : We use the expand-around-center technique to find the longest palindromic substring. Each character (and each pair of adjacent characters) is treated as a potential center, and we expand outward while the characters match. The function checkCount() finds the longest palindrome centered at (i, i) for odd-length and (i, i+1) for even-length palindromes. We track the maximum length and starting index, then return the longest palindrome.
// keep in mind chehcing both cases is needed or it might lead to failure if you have lets say ccc or aaaa if you try if else
// TC : O(n square) 
// Each center is expanded outward until the characters mismatch. In the worst case (when the string is all the same character), each expansion runs O(N). Since we check N centers, the total complexity is O(nÂ²).
// SC : O(1)
